The Batch file in this folder uses AVRDUDE to flash the binarys of MicroAPRS to the Arduino Pro Mini. 
Originally I had the MicroAPRS binarys in this folder as well as a copy of AVRDUDE. 
However that is bad practice (and prob against their licenses) so I have removed them. I am leaving this batch file
here so that it can be used if needed. The MicroAPRS repo has good information on how to flash it anyway.
